- ### But Keep mind that total Arcade points `wouldn't be included Facilitator Program Milestone Bonus Points`
- ### They wouldn't say about Facilitator Milestone Bonus points, only normal arcade points
- ### But you can add bonus points over your total Arcade points & that will your total arcade points
- ### For Example, The Representative ask me, i have total 47 Arcade points, but i reached Ultimate Milestone by the Arcade Facilitator Milestone, so for Ultimate Milestone Bonus points is 25 Arcade points. So Now i have total 47+25=72 Arcade Points.
- ### As well same process for other three Facilitator Program's User Milesones Bonus Points

- ### They will clearly tell that, about Facilitator Program Milestone Bonus points will be added & will get update on it before opening Prize counter
- ### So manually, you count easily
- ### As i mentioned, just add your Facilitator Achieved milestone's bonus points with your total arcade points have, whatever told by Qwiklabs team in chat support.
